# Bank of Flatiron

Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial
data! Use the below gif as an example of how the app should function.



## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

## Setup

After forking the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run-script`. This will run your backend on port `8001`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `8000`.

Make sure to open
[http://localhost:8001/transactions](http://localhost:8001/transactions) in the
browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!.

## Endpoints

The base URL for your backend is: `http://localhost:6003`

## Core Deliverables

As a user, You will be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new
  transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a
  description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions
  table.
